# Record Tracker Update: Multi-Player Support

This update modifies the Record Tracker system to support all Timberwolves players instead of just Anthony Edwards.

## What's Changed

### 1. Supabase Function Update
The `create_record_tracker_season` function has been updated to:
- Loop through all Timberwolves players (not just Anthony Edwards)
- Generate record tracking data for each player
- Support all 13 stat categories for every player

### 2. Frontend Component Updates
- Added player selector dropdown above the stat selector
- Updated `useRecordData` hook to support multiple players
- Modified `RecordTracker` component to show selected player data

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update Supabase Function
Run the SQL migration in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of: supabase/migrations/20250215194104_update_record_tracker_function.sql
```

Or manually create the function in your Supabase SQL editor.

### Step 2: Update Python Script
The `update_record_tracker.py` script will now work with the updated function and populate data for all players.

### Step 3: Frontend Updates
The following files have been updated:
- `src/hooks/useRecordData.ts` - Added multi-player support
- `src/components/RecordTracker.tsx` - Added player selector

### Step 4: Test the System
1. Run your Python script to populate the updated data
2. Refresh your frontend application
3. Use the player selector to switch between different Timberwolves players

## New Features

### Player Selector
- Dropdown menu showing all available Timberwolves players
- Automatically loads data for the selected player
- Maintains selected stat when switching players

### Multi-Player Data
- Each player now has complete record tracking data
- Personal records, franchise records, and NBA records for all players
- Progress charts and projections for every player-stat combination

## Data Structure

The `record_tracker_season` table now contains:
- Multiple rows per stat category (one for each player)
- Player name in the `name` field
- All the same stat tracking information per player

## Troubleshooting

### If the function fails to run:
1. Check that all required tables exist
2. Verify RLS policies allow the function to access data
3. Check Supabase logs for specific error messages

### If no players appear:
1. Ensure the `timberwolves_player_stats_season` table has data
2. Verify the `twolves_player_game_logs` table has game data
3. Check that the function executed successfully

### If charts don't display:
1. Verify game logs exist for the selected player
2. Check that the `useRecordData` hook is receiving data
3. Ensure the component is properly handling the new data structure
